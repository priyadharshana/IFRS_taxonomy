# 📊 IFRS Taxonomy ETL
Please note: This is still in development and not yet production-ready.

**IFRS Taxonomy ETL** is an open-source Python project that provides an Extract–Transform–Load (ETL) process for converting the **IFRS Accounting Taxonomy 2025 Excel file** into structured, machine-readable formats.  
The goal is to make the taxonomy easier to use in analytics tools, databases, and hierarchical models — while respecting IFRS Foundation intellectual property.

---

## ✨ Features

- Converts the official IFRS Excel taxonomy into:
  - **Adjacency list** (`df_hierarchy`)
  - **Materialized path** (`df_materialized_path`)
  - **Nested JSON tree** (`taxonomy_tree`)
- Preserves taxonomy fidelity while enabling flexible downstream use
- Provides governance-ready outputs with clear documentation
- Designed for educational, analytical, and research purposes
